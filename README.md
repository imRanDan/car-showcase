# car-showcase
A TypeScript / Next.JS / React-based app that fetches a car API and displays different car models with a functioning search bar and filter components.

**Link to project:** https://car-showcase-93id.vercel.app/

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** TypeScript - React - NextJS - HeadlessUI - TailWindCSS


## Optimizations
I would have liked to expand on it a bit more but I think for the tech I wanted to work with and for the functionalities and components I wanted to display, this is a good starting point.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about using TypeScript to work with creating the components and functionalities of the app. Learned more about components, constants, types, utils, and hooks. Why it is important to organize them (even if it is a lot of work at first, if one wants to scale and expand the application, TS and using this organization will help do so and will save time down the line). I also built this to show from the serverside and had to convert to client-side, as when I was building with next13, there was a glitch where if one were to click the search bar or filters, it would scroll back to the top. Now that Next14 is out (I am not sure if this is fixed) I should probably check to see if it is fixed (this note was mode Nov 4th, 2023)


##how to use

By clicking on the live link, you will be taking to the landing page. As it is frontend only, and focused more on the search / filter results and pulling information from a database from RapidAPI, I left the links to not link anywhere. Scroll down to the car catalogue and you will be able to enter in a car company, a model, and filter it by year or whether it runs on gas or electricity.
